## Movement Mechanics

### Action Points
- Each unit starts with **2 Action Points (AP)** per turn
- **1 AP Movement**: Move to an orange-highlighted tile (short distance)
- **2 AP Movement**: Move to a white-highlighted tile (longer distance)
- Most actions (attacks, abilities) consume all remaining AP
- AP can be split across multiple units before being spent

### Speed
- Determines movement range per AP
- Base speed is typically **4 tiles per AP**
- Can be modified by traits, equipment, or age
- Maximum movement per turn = Speed × 2 (with both AP spent on movement)

### Movement Rules
1. **Tile Costs**:
   - Orthogonal movement: 1 movement point per tile
   - Diagonal movement: 1.5 movement points (requires clear path)
   - Cannot move through obstacles or other units

2. **Movement Restrictions**:
   - Cannot move through enemy units
   - Can move between friendly units only diagonally
   - Diagonal movement requires all tiles in the path to be unobstructed

3. **Special Cases**:
   - Moving around an enemy requires full movement (4 points: left, forward, forward, right)
   - Some abilities may modify movement rules (e.g., Charge, Free Throw)

### Strategic Considerations
- **Scouts**: High-movement units excel at exploring and spotting
- **Positioning**: Moving to high ground or cover can provide combat advantages
- **AP Management**: Leaving 1 AP for reaction moves can be tactically valuable
- **Obstacle Navigation**: Plan routes carefully around obstacles and enemies

### Example Movement
- **Speed 4 Unit**:
  - 1 AP: Move up to 4 tiles orthogonally or ~2.6 tiles diagonally
  - 2 AP: Move up to 8 tiles orthogonally or ~5.3 tiles diagonally
  - 1 AP Move + 1 AP Attack: Move 4 tiles and perform an action
